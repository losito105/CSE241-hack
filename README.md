# CSE241-hack
This program simplifies tedious tasks associated with work that has to be done before a circuit is constructed on a breadboard.

It automates 3 of the most common steps in the design process of a simple circuit:
1. Generating Truth Tables 
2. Finding Canonical Functions
3. Generating K-Maps

This project was created specifically to make the lives of students taking CSE241 at The University at Buffalo easier.
It automates the about 50% of the course allowing students to focus on construction of their circuits after they understand 
how to do the things this program automates by hand.

Notable Acheivements:
This program was one of three winners at the 2018 Fall Semester Hack Night Competition at The University at Buffalo.
